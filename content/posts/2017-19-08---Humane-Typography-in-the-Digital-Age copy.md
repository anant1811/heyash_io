- Meta: [[grow]], [[work]]
- What information we need to collect? 
    - Important product updates from [[grow]] focus
    - What the [[grow]] focus is working on for next two weeks/ near future
    - What the [[grow]] focus worked on in the last two weeks
    - Do the [[grow]] focus teams need our/HE help? 
        - If so, what help do they need?
        - And how would we arrange help for them?
- How do we collect that info, and where do save the info??
    - We need to keep a log of all the info somewhere, and the platform needs to be collaborative so I and Bernat can both use it. 
    - The info will mostly come from these palces:
        - Venture's and Rubik's biweekly posts
        - Posts/xPosts in Grow (from Design team as well) and other P2s
        - From our customers via tickets, chats and forums
        - From Slack convos
    - I'm thinking of a weekly log in a P2 like Doug does. 1 weekly post each monday, and we add the links and thoughts as comments. At the end of the week, we collate the important bits from the weekly log. 
- How do we filter out the important info from all the info?
